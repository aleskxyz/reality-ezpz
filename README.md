## Quick Start
You can start using this script with default configuration by copy and paste the line below in terminal.

This command will configure `sing-box` with `reality` security protocol over `tcp` transport protocol on port `443` for `www.google.com` SNI domain by default:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez)
```
or (if the above command dosen't work):
```
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleskxyz/reality-ezpz/master/reality-ezpz.sh)
```
After a while you will get configuration string and QR code:

You can run TUI with `-m` or `--menu` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) -m
```
And then you will see management menu in your terminal:

## Security Options
This script can configure the service with 3 types of security options:
- reality
- letsencrypt
- selfsigned

By default `reality` is configured but you can change the security protocol with `--security` option.

The `letsencrypt` option will use Letsencrypt to get a valid certificate for you server. So you have to assign a valid domain or subdomain to your server with `--server <domain>` option.

The `selfsigned` option is same as `letsencrypt` but the certificates are self-signed and you don't need to assign a domain or subdomain to your server.

## Compatibility and recommendation
CDN compatibility table:

|   | Cloudflare | ArvanCloud |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| reality | :x: | :x: |
| selfsigned | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| letsencrypt | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| tcp  | :x:  | :x:  |
| http  | :x:  | :heavy_check_mark:  |
| grpc  | :heavy_check_mark:  | :heavy_check_mark:  |
| ws  | :heavy_check_mark:  | :heavy_check_mark:  |
| tuic  | :x:  | :x:  |
| hysteria2  | :x:  | :x:  |
| shadowtls  | :x:  | :x:  |

- You need to enable `grpc` or `websocket` in Cloudflare if you want to use the corresponding transport protocols.
- You have to configure CDN provider to use HTTPS for connecting to your server.
- The `ws` transport protocol is not compatible with `reality` security option.
- The `tuic` tunneling protocol is not compatible with `reality` security option.
- The `tuic` tunneling protocol is only compatible with `sing-box` core option.
- The `hysteria2` tunneling protocol is not compatible with `reality` security option.
- The `hysteria2` tunneling protocol is only compatible with `sing-box` core option.
- The `shadowtls` tunneling protocol is only compatible with `sing-box` core option.
- Avoid using `tcp` transport protocol with `letsencrypt` or `selfsigned` security options.
- Avoid using `selfsigned` security option. Get a domain and use `letsencrypt` option.
- Do not change the port to something other than `443`.
- The `sing-box` core has better performance.
- Using [NekoBox](https://github.com/MatsuriDayo/NekoBoxForAndroid/releases) for Android is recommended.

## User Management
You can add, view and delete multiple user account with this script easily!

### Add User
You can add additional user by using `--add-user` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --add-user user1
```
This command will create `test1` as a new user.

Notice: Username can only contains A-Z, a-z and 0-9

### List Users
You can view a list of all users by using `--list-users` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --list-users
```

### Show User Configuration
You can get config string and QR code of the user for importing by using `--show-user` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --show-user user1
```
This command will print config string and QR code of `user1`

### Delete User
You can delete a user by using `--delete-user` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --delete-user user1
```
This command will delete `user1`

## Advanced Configuration
You can change script defaults by using different arguments.

Your configuration will be saved and restored in each execution. So You can run the script multiple time with out any problem.

### Change SNI domain
Reality protocol will use the public certificate of SNI domain.

Default SNI domain is `www.google.com`.

You can change it by using `--domain` or `-d` options:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) -d yahoo.com
```
### Change transport protocol
Default transport protocol is `tcp`.

You can change it by using `--transport` or `-t` options:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) -t http
```
Valid options are `tcp`,`http`, `grpc`, `ws`, `tuic`, `hysteria2` and `shadowtls`.

`ws` is not compatible with reality protocol. You have to use `letsencrypt` or `selfsigned` with it.

`tuic` is not compatible with reality protocol. You have to use `letsencrypt` or `selfsigned` with it.

`tuic` is compatible with sing-box core only.

`hysteria2` is not compatible with reality protocol. You have to use `letsencrypt` or `selfsigned` with it.

`hysteria2` is compatible with sing-box core only.

`shadowtls` is compatible with sing-box core only.

#### ShadowTLS
ShadowTLS is a TLS disguise proxy that can use someone else's trusted certificate. It is similar to "Reality," but in transport, it uses Shadowsocks. So you need to assign a working SNI to it.

When you enable ShadowTLS, you will configure two proxies: ShadowTLS and Shadowsocks.

You need to configure your client to use both proxies in chain mode.

First, ShadowTLS will establish a secure connection with the server, then Shadowsocks will use the connection created by ShadowTLS.

### Block malware and adult contents
You can block malware and adult contents by using `--enable-safenet` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --enable-safenet true
```
You can disable this feature with `--enable-safenet false` option.

### Get runnig configuration
You can get the running configuration with `--show-server-config` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --show-server-config
```

### Regenerate configuration keys
You can regenerate keys by using `--regenerate` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --regenerate
```
All other configuration will be same as before.

### Restart services
You can restart the service by using `-r` or `--restart` options:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) -r
```

### Restore default configuration
You can restore default configuration by using `--default` option.
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --default
```
User account will not change with this option.

### Uninstall
You can delete configuration and services by using `--uninstall` or `-u` options:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) -u
```

### Change port
Notice: Do not change default port. This may block your IP!

Default port is `443`.

In case of using `letsencrypt` security option, port `80` has to be available for Letsencrypt challenge.

You can change it by using `--port` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --port 8443
```

### Change engine core
Default engine core is sing-box but you can also switch to xray by using `--core` or `-c` options:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) -c xray
```
Valid options are `xray` and `sing-box`.

### Create backup
You can create a backup from users and configuration and upload it to https://temp.sh/ by using `--backup` option.

The `--backup-password` option allows you to protect the backup zip file with the specified password. (Optional)
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --backup --backup-password "P@ssw0rd"
```
This command will give you a URL to download you backup file. The URL is only valid for 3 days.

### Restore backup
You can restore a previously created backup file with `--restore` option.

You need to give the path or URL of the backup file to restore.

The `--backup-password` option allows you to restore the password protected backup zip file.
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --restore /path/to/backup.zip --backup-password "P@ssw0rd"
```
or
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --restore "https://www.example.com/backup.zip" --backup-password "P@ssw0rd"
```

You can migrate users and configuration from one server to another by:

1. Create backup in the old server and copy the URL of backup file
1. Restore the URL of backup file in the new server

### Text-based user interface (TUI)
You can also use the TUI for changing the configuration of the service.

To access to TUI you can use `-m` or `--menu` options:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) -m
```

## Telegram Bot
You can manage users with Telegram Bot.

You should get a Telegram bot token from `@BotFather` Telegram account.

Then you can enable Telegram bot by using this command as an example:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --enable-tgbot true --tgbot-token <telegram-bot-token> --tgbot-admins=<your-telegram-username>
```
In the command above you have to provide a comma separated list of Telegram usernames (without leading '@') which are authorized to use Telegram bot.

You can disable Telegram bot with this command:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --enable-tgbot false
```

## Cloudflare WARP
This script uses official Cloudflare WARP client for connecting to Cloudflare network and send all outbound traffic to Cloudflare server. So your servers address will be masked by Cloudflare IPs. This gives you a better web surffing experience due to less captcha challenges and also resolves some websites limitations on your servers IP.

You can enable Cloudflare WARP by using `--enable-warp true` option. This script will create and register a free WAPR account and use it.
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --enable-warp true
```
Free account has traffic limitation and lower performance in comparison with WARP+ account which needs license.

You can either buy an WARP+ Unlimited license or get a free WARP+ license from this telegram bot: https://t.me/generatewarpplusbot

After getting a license from that telegram bot, you can use the license for your server with `--warp-license` option:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --warp-license aaaaaaaa-bbbbbbbb-cccccccc
```
You can use each warp+ license on 4 devices only.

You can disable Cloudflare WARP with `--enable-warp false`:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --enable-warp false
```

## Example
You can combine different options together.

We want to setup a server with these configurations:
* `grpc` transport protocol
* `www.wikipedia.org` as SNI domain
* Block adult contents
* Enable Cloudflare WARP
* Set Cloudflare WARP+ license

So we need to execute this command:
```
bash <(curl -sL https://bit.ly/realityez) --transport=grpc --domain=www.wikipedia.com --enable-safenet=true --enable-warp=true --warp-license=26z9i0ld-WG0wy324-rA703nZ2
```
## Custom Configuration
Use this feature only if you know exactly what you are doing!

You can override the configuration generated by the script and add your own custom configuration to it.

Write your custom configuration in one of these files based on the engine that you are using:

```
/opt/reality-ezpz/sing-box.patch
```
or
```
/opt/reality-ezpz/xray.patch
```
And run script to apply your changes.

For example if you want to increase the debug level of sing-box engine, you can create `/opt/reality-ezpz/sing-box.patch` with this content:
```
{
  "log": {
    "level": "debug",
    "timestamp": true
  }
}
```
